Kitchenbug is the ultimate tool for food bloggers, providing full recipe nutritional analysis, rich-snippets compliance, unit conversion and more.

== Description ==

Kitchenbug for bloggers is the ultimate tool for wordpress food bloggers who publish recipes. Our team of certified cooks, UX experts, computer engineers, registered dietitians and food bloggers strives continuously to identify food bloggers needs and meet them.

We put an emphasis on a user friendly experience, presenting a recipe, rich with information and capabilities,which is easy to read and use. Yes, it does not take a Ph.D from MIT to enjoy Kitchenbug!

* The Kitchenbug plugin performs a complete nutritional analysis of your recipe and formats it to comply with rich-snippets standards. In addition, we provide you with many additional cool features such as information regarding any ingredient and built-in scale and servings changes. In order to do this - your recipe will be sent via secure connection to our servers, where it will be analyzed, formatted and returned to you.
Write your recipes as you normally do - we'll take care of all of the rest.
* Please note - In order to use the plugin, analyze and publish recipes, you'll need to register with Facebook or sign up on our website (http://www.kitchenbug.com).
* Automatic recipe analysis is currently only available in English.

**Features**

*   **Detailed Nutritional data on any recipe** - The Kitchenbug plugin enables you to provide your readers with comprehensive nutritional information. By facilitating its state-of-the-art technology, the plugin analyzes any recipe and calculates, automatically and immediately, information such as caloric value, fat content, carbohydrates, protein etc. Transparency builds trust and readers for life. Be transparent, provide your readers with nutritional analysis, your readers will appreciate it!
*   **Powerful SEO Tool, Generating Tags for search engine Bots** - After analyzing the recipe, the plugin automatically tags all the acquired information in compliance with the rich-snippets recipe schema for seo, so that their crawlers can read it, find it and use it for better seo. Note: most Bloggers aren't able to tell how many calories a recipe is worth, or if it fits one of numerous diet plans and more. Thus, even if they know how to program their blog to comply with rich-snippets, they do not have the information to feed the template. In other words - the rich-snippets schema remains an empty template and do not boost SEO. Kitchenbug's plugin solves this. It analyzes a recipe, outputs its missing information and converts it automatically to rich-snippets recipe format standards.
*   **Built in Converting US to Metric measurements** - Using the Kitchenbug plugin provides your readers with the ability to convert measurements from US to metric units and vice versa.
*   **Built in Yield Modification** - While most online recipes are designed for four people, in reality we cook for any number of people - five, seven, thirteen etc. Kitchenbug's recipe plugin solves this by providing a yield modification feature for the blogger\'s readers.
*   **Ingredient Information** - You know of your recipe ingredients, and most of them will know what are cherry tomatoes, but less people know what Ahi is. Use Kitchenbug to provide your readers with information regarding all of your recipe's ingredients. With our plugin your readers can get instant encyclopedia information regarding any ingredient. We provide this in a user friendly bubble format.
*   **Print Recipes** - The plugin allows blog viewers to print the recipe in a simple, kitchen-ready format.
*   **Collect Button** - If you wish, blog viewers will be able to collect your recipe to their online recipe box.

The Kitchenbug Plug-in helps you dig into your recipe and get comprehensive nutritional info about the recipe. The plug-in analyzes both the ingredients in the recipe and their quantities and generates nutritional labels for the recipe. These labels may indicate if this recipe fits any diet, religion or health constraint. Moreover the plug-in generates the "Nutrition Facts" table for the recipe and lets you know for each nutrient in the recipe if it is "High", "Low" or "Free". This tool is an opportunity to create a perfect fit of the recipe to your needs. Understanding recipes better has a great value in a world of a growing well-being trend and in light of the fact that more people today seek information about food - whether it is a great recipe, a special diet or a helpful cooking tip.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How does Kitchenbug WP Plugin work? =
Kitchenbug uses cutting-edge algorithms implementing Natural Language Processing technology and semantic analysis. We use them to explore the recipe and extract information which does not appear in the recipe, e.g: calories, saturated fat, sugar free, low sodium, high calcium etc.

= How do I add a recipe? =
In order to add a recipe to your Wordpress blog, using Kitchenbug:

1. Make sure the the Kitchenbug plugin is installed; If it is not, install it now.
2. Once the plugin is installed, you should see the Kitchenbug  icon (Marked in red in the image below), in your visual editor.
3. Click on the Kitchenbug icon to open the "add recipe" screen
4. Now enter the recipe title, cooking, prep time, ingredients, cooking directions and more. Note - When adding ingredients: be sure to enter one ingredient per row. We recommend using a standard format for ingredients (example: "2 lb chopped tomatoes". format template: [amount] [Unit type] [ingredient and prep]), in order to make recipes more readable and assist Kitchenbug's nutritional analysis automatic process. When entering directions, use "enter" to separate between the preparation stages. This will create bullet items per direction stage.
5. Once you're done filling in the "Add recipe" form, click on "Continue" at the top of the form. This will perform the nutritional analysis and direct you to the tagging screen.
6. In the tagging screen, you can manually add any tag you want to your recipe, by typing them in separated by comma.
7. Add an image to your recipe, by direct uploading or by adding it to your wordpress gallery.
8. Once done click on the "Add recipe to post" button to insert your recipe into the editor. This will create a textual place holder for your recipe (example: [kitchenbug-your-recipe-appears-here-231]), which represents the location of the recipe in your post, once published.

= Note =: In order to edit an existing recipe, simply click on the Kitchenbug Mustache button, to re-open the relevant form.

= What are "Recipe Themes"?  =
Your readers eat with their eyes.

Your blog and your recipes are your personal outlet, and you want both to have their own unique look. Kitchenbug Wordpress Plugin allows you to install, design and switch between themes, therefore changing the way your recipes look and behave inside your blog.

By using any of the themes provided with the Kitchenbug Wordpress Plugin, you can easily adapt a distinct look for your recipes. Alternatively, you can design your own theme according to your own wishes.
Simply go to the Kitchenbug settings page, select a recipe theme, and save your changes, and your blog's recipes' display will change immediately.

= How can I create my own recipe theme? =
Follow this link for more information on creating themes:
http://getsatisfaction.com/kitchenbug/topics/making_your_own_theme

= How do I add recipe sections to ingredients and directions? =
The Kitchenbug plugin performs a thorough analysis of your recipe's text, in order to provide you with its nutrition values and food labels.

In order for the analysis process to identify a section header in your recipe (such as "for the sauce" etc.), use the following rule:
Start your recipe section header with a colon punctuation. Example: ":Sauce"
This will generate a header titled "Sauce", in bold.

= Why does the recipe appear in my blog homepage, archive or search pages? =
By default, recipes are rendered wherever a shortcode appears in your post. In order to change this behavior, turn on the excerpt feature in the Kitchenbug Settings page and a short summary of the recipe will appear instead.

= What do the plugin analysis errors mean? =
Kitchenbug's culinary engine analyzes your recipes in order to provide your viewers with nutritional information. Our team of registered dietitians constantly works at adding nutritional information, so that every ingredient in your recipe is correctly identified. However, since the number of ingredients is enormous and each ingredient can be written in various ways, you may encounter issues that prevent a full analysis.
Our culinary engine handles these issues by displaying one of the following errors messages:

1. Could not recognize a valid ingredient - there are several reasons for generating this error: One of your ingredients might not be in our database, it could be an exotic fruit or vegetable, a special cut of meat or perhaps a brand we are not familiar with. When this occurs, the ingredient is automatically sent to our team and you will be notified as soon as it is added to our database. Another option is that the ingredient is misspelled, for example Parmezan cheese instead of Parmesan cheese. If the ingredient is not food, for example, metal skewers, toothpicks or plastic wrap, the 'ingredient' is automatically checked and added to our ignore list at a later date.
2. Could not recognize a valid weight - This error is shown when an ingredient exists in our database, however the weight entered for the ingredient does not. For example, '1 cup rib eye steak' is not a recognized weight, however '1 rib eye steak' is. If you encounter this error and believe that the weight you require should be included, please let us know and we will add the missing weight.

= What happens if an ingredient is unidentified? =
Kitchenbug uses a constantly updating its database, provided by the US Department of Agriculture and additional sources. The DB includes over 12,000 ingredients, ranging from the most basic fruits and vegetables to more complex household products such as Oreo cookies, Heinz Ketchup and more.
However, sometimes ingredients in your recipe might not be identified due to any number of reasons (misspelling, unidentified synonyms and more). When this happens, you, as a user, are prompted to make the relevant changes needed in order to complete the analysis process. In addition, you can always skip this process and publish your recipe without nutritional information.
In addition, we are automatically notified when problems occur during the analysis process, and consequently update the DB with the relevant info. Due to the steep learning curve of the system, in time these events will not occur.

= How does the plug-in help with my SEO? =
Rich Snippet Support
Kitchenbug is the only Plugin that delivers an A to Z solution for rich-snippets. Rich snippets are the basic tool to get good recipe SEO on the internet.
All of Kitchenbug's recipes are structured to comply with the rich-snippets recipe schema. However, Kitchenbug is the only plugin that not only creates the template, but also analyzes your recipe, generates data - And fills in the blanks for you. Making you more findable and visible.
The Kitchenbug plugin analyzes the recipe, extracts all the necessary info out of it (caloric value, fat level etc...) and automatically creates all of the relevant tags, from the basic cooking time and ingredients, to the more complex full nutritional information. When publishing a recipe using Kitchenbug's plugin it will format this information in order to comply with rich-snippets requirements.
The Kitchenbug plug-in does all of the dirty technical work, such as recipe analysis and formatting for you, leaving you free to do what you want to do - cook and write about food.

= Can I add more than one recipe per post? =
At this stage, no. Adding more than one recipe with the Kitchenbug plugin is not possible. This is done for SEO purposes, and in compliance with google's rich snippets limitations. According to Google, using recipe markups on a page containing multiple recipes is not supported.

= What is Dig in ? =
The Kitchenbug plugin is a great tool to get nutritional info about your recipe, whether if it is for specific diet purposes or even if it is just to make an informed decision. Once analyzed, nutritional values are presented and labels are created to interpret the numbers into comprehensible data. Highlight nutrients (calories, fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium and carbohydrates) are presented right above the ingredients with auto tags in different colors to indicate if these are nutrients to limit or to get enough of. This is so simple and easy to understand.
The newly designed "Dig in" screen provides blog readers with the most comprehensive nutritional and dietary information regarding the recipe, including the familiar "Nutrition Facts" table and a full nutritional analysis and clear dietary labels (such as "High Fiber", "Low Calorie", "High Vitamin C" and numerous more).
